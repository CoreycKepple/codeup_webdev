	<h1>Hello from CodeUp!</h1>
	<p> My name is Corey Kepple and I am currently enrolled in CodeUp's intesive programming bootcamp.  I hope to become a capable programmer who can transition from the classroom to the office easily.  Doing this will require intense work and focus to learn all I possibly can in a short period of time.  I know I can accomplish my goals and will be able to pursue a new and fulfilling career in the technology sector</p>
